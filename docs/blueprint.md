ChainWatch – Cold Chain Monitoring on Algorand

ChainWatch is a blockchain-based cold chain logistics monitoring platform powered by Algorand. It provides real-time, role-based batch tracking, AI-driven risk prediction, and decentralized verification of temperature-sensitive shipments using the reliability and security of the Algorand blockchain.

🚀 Core Features

🔐 Role-Based Authentication
Secure login with role-specific permissions: Admin, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, Inspector, and Customer.

📊 Dashboard Overview
Role-specific dashboards showing batch summaries, delivery statuses, and live alerts.

📦 Batch Management with Algorand
Register and anchor batch metadata (ID, product, origin, GPS, temperature threshold, and attachments like invoices/images) on the Algorand blockchain for tamper-proof verification.
QR code is auto-generated for each batch.

✅ Batch Verification (On-Chain)
Scan or enter a batch ID to retrieve verified on-chain data:

Status

GPS path

Checkpoints

Temperature logs (IoT simulated)

Blockchain hash for audit trail

🗺️ Map Tracking (React Leaflet)
Real-time map visualizations:

Live vehicle tracking

Custom icons for checkpoints

Polyline for delivery route

Simulated GPS and temperature sensor data

🌡️ Cold Chain Alerts (Real-Time)
Visual indicators when temperature crosses threshold using live simulated data. Alerts are logged both in the system and on-chain for transparency.

🧠 AI-Driven Risk Prediction
Historical data is analyzed using AI to flag high-risk batches and predict temperature breach points before they happen.

🌐 Blockchain Layer: Algorand Integration

All critical batch data (hashes, timestamps, temp thresholds, GPS checkpoints) are recorded on Algorand to ensure transparency and immutability.

Integrates Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) to validate batch integrity and access control.

Utilizes Algorand JavaScript SDK for seamless web integration and wallet interaction.
