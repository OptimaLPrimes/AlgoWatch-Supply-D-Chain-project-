## 🏗️ Architecture Overview – Powered by Algorand

AlgoWatch leverages the Algorand blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and efficient decentralized supply chain platform. Below is an outline of its core architectural components and how they integrate with Algorand's ecosystem:

🧱 1. Blockchain Layer – Algorand

Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS):
All transactions and smart contract executions happen on Algorand’s scalable and eco-friendly consensus protocol, ensuring fast finality (~4.5 seconds) and low fees.

Algorand Standard Assets (ASA):
Every product batch or shipment can be represented as a unique ASA, allowing on-chain tracking of ownership, movement, and status updates.

Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1):
Business logic like transfer approvals, compliance checks, temperature limits, or time-bound events are enforced via stateful and stateless smart contracts written in TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language).

Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM):
Supports custom contract logic for validating:

Batch handoffs (e.g., manufacturer → distributor)

Role permissions (e.g., only inspectors can update temperature logs)

Delivery SLA enforcement (e.g., timeout if shipment delayed)

Rekeying Feature:
Efficient account management for role-based access control across organizations without having to create new wallets for every identity.

🔐 2. Access & Identity Layer

Wallet Integration:
Support for MyAlgo Wallet, Pera Wallet, and WalletConnect for users to interact with the blockchain.

Role-Based Identity Verification:
Roles like Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, Inspector, and Consumer are mapped to wallet addresses using smart contract-based access controls.

KYC/Compliance (Optional):
If needed, off-chain identity verification can be integrated before granting blockchain roles, using services like Civic or other Algorand-compatible KYC providers.

📦 3. Asset & Event Management

Batch Tokenization (ASA):

Each batch is minted as an ASA with metadata (batch ID, origin, temp limits, timestamps, etc.)

Transfer of ASA = transfer of ownership/responsibility in the supply chain

On-Chain Event Logging:

Checkpoint events (pickup, handoff, delivery) logged via transactions with attached metadata (geolocation, timestamp)

Temperature logs or violations logged as smart contract interactions, stored immutably on-chain

IPFS for File Storage:
Documents like bills, certifications, images are stored off-chain using IPFS; their content hashes are saved on-chain in the batch record.

🛰️ 4. IoT & Data Simulation Integration

IoT Devices (Simulated or Real):
GPS and temperature sensors can push data to the backend, which then validates against smart contract thresholds before:

Triggering alerts

Logging events on-chain

Freezing ASA if breach occurs (e.g., spoilage)

Cold Chain Alert System:
AI + contract logic can flag batches for inspection or prevent further transfers if they breach compliance (e.g., > 8°C for pharma)

📊 5. Frontend (dApp Interface)

React + Tailwind UI with real-time data via:

Algorand Indexer: For querying on-chain state and transactions

AlgoExplorer API: For visualizing transaction history

Socket.io / MQTT: For live updates from simulated IoT streams

QR Code Scanning & Verification

Scanning a batch QR code retrieves on-chain info:

Status

Ownership trail

Checkpoint history

Temperature logs

Associated documents via IPFS links

🧠 6. AI/ML Layer (Optional Add-On)

Risk Prediction Engine:
Historical temperature + location data used to train ML models to predict future breaches or high-risk routes

Can trigger proactive smart contract actions (e.g., re-routing, alerts) if confidence exceeds threshold
